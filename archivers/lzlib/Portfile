description         \
    Lzlib is a data compression library providing in-memory LZMA compression \
    and decompression functions

long_description        \
    {*}${description}, including integrity checking of the decompressed data. \
    The compressed data format used by the library is the lzip format. Lzlib \
    is written in C. The lzip file format is designed for data sharing and \
    long-term archiving, taking into account both data integrity and decoder \
    availability\: The lzip format provides very safe integrity checking and \
    some data recovery means. The program lziprecover can repair bit flip \
    errors \(one of the most common forms of data corruption\) in lzip files, \
    and provides data recovery capabilities, including error-checked merging \
    of damaged copies of a file. The lzip format is as simple as possible \
    \(but not simpler\). The lzip manual provides the source code of a simple \
    decompressor along with a detailed explanation of how it works, so that \
    with the only help of the lzip manual it would be possible for a digital \
    archaeologist to extract the data from a lzip file long after quantum \
    computers eventually render LZMA obsolete. Additionally the lzip \
    reference implementation is copylefted, which guarantees that it will \
    remain free forever.
